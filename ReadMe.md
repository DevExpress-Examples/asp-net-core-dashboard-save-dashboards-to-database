# BI Dashboard for ASP.NET Core - How to load and save dashboards from/to a database

This example shows how to create custom dashboard storage in an ASP.NET Core application and to store dashboards in a database.
To create custom dashboard storage, implement [IDashboardStorage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IDashboardStorage?p=netframework) or [IEditableDashboardStorage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IEditableDashboardStorage).

This example also contains an SQL file ([SavedDashboards.sql](./CS/SaveDashboardDB/SavedDashboards.sql)). You can use it to recreate a database on your side. Do not forget to update the connection string in the **appsettings.json** file to make it valid in your environment.

The following API is used in the example:

- [LoadDashboard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IDashboardStorage.LoadDashboard(System.String))Â 

    Loads a dashboard with the specified ID in XDocument format from storage.
- [GetAvailableDashboardsInfo](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IDashboardStorage.GetAvailableDashboardsInfo)Â 

    Returns a list of IDs and Captions of dashboards available in the data storage.
- [SaveDashboard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IDashboardStorage.SaveDashboard(System.String-System.Xml.Linq.XDocument))Â 

    Saves theÂ specified dashboard with new settings to the dashboard storage.
- [AddDashboard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IEditableDashboardStorage.AddDashboard(System.Xml.Linq.XDocument-System.String)) 

   Saves a dashboard definition and its caption to the data storage and returns the ID of the new saved dashboard.
